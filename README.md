Ever wondered what Mars Looks like. Wouldn't it be good to have a handy application to get Images directly from NASA. NASAv1 might be worth looking at.

How it works : 
NASA's API provide general public and developers to access their resources and databases. Just get the API key after registering at the NASA's website.
The application makes a get request using internet to fetch images from their vast library and show it on the UI.
